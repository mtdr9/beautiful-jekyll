Americans love meat, and per capita, we eat more than any other country in the world (our runners-up are Kuwait and Australia<sup>1</sup>). When I think of the american meat industry, I think of beef. But beef is not #trending in the US - since 1976 beef consumption has slowly declined. Here's what it looks like:

Chicken is on the rise! Since 1965, meat consumption has been generally increasing, and chicken is the main driver behind that growth.

I created this graphs as part of [Makeover Monday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/), in which the blog posts a visualization and the underlying dataset. I was curious to see what consumption looked like for different kinds of meat, as well as just how much chicken and beef had changed. Here is the original graph:
